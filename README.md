# End-to-end Stock Price Prediction Project in Python

Simple end-to-end project for predicting stock prices using historical data. 
This project will invoilve the following steps:

# Data Collection:
I use an API to collect stock market data.

# Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning and preparing the data.

# Feature Engineering:
Creating features for the model.

# Modeling:
Using machine learning model to predict stock prices.

# Evaluation:
Evaluating the model's performance.

# Step 1:
Install the libraries yfinance, numpy, panda, scikit-learn, matplotlib using PIP

# Step 2:
Import libraries

# Step 3:
Data Collection :
I use the yfinance library to download stock data

# Step 4:
Data Preprocessing:
I use only the 'Close' price for prediction, and I create a target column that represents the stock price for the next day.

# Step 5:
Train the model:
I use a simple Random Forest Regression model to predict the stock prices.

# Step 6:
Evaluation:
I evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error(MAE).

# Step 7:
Visualization:
I plot the actual vs predicted stock prices to visualize  how well the model performs.


# Summary:
    # Objective:
        Predict the next day's stock price using historical data.
    # Steps:
        Data collection, Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Modeling, and Evaluation.
    # Model:
        Random Forest Regressor
    # Metric:
        Mean Absolute Error

This project is a basic start and can be enhanced by adding more features like moving averages, volume, or even more complex models like LSTMs for better performance.
